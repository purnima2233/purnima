            <p>Ramakrishna (RK) Beach stretches 4km up the coast from the large port area in the south of town, 
                overlooking the Bay of Bengal with its mammoth ships and brightly painted fishing boats.
                 Its pedestrian promenade is great for strolling. Swimming is officially prohibited (and the sea polluted).
                 Ramakrishna Beach, more popularly known as RK Beach in Visakhapatnam is located in the heart of the city’s coastline.
                  If you stand in the middle, on the right you can see the Dolphin’s Nose, and on the left, you can see the INS Kursura parked 
                  just by the sea. Beach gets its name from the Ramakrishna Ashram which is located across the road from 
                  the beach and I assume may have one of the first public buildings there to lend the beach its name.
