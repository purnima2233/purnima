        <p>The origin of the temple is traced to the year 1912, when people discovered the idol of the presiding deity in a well near Burujupeta (fort of the then rulers).
             The idol was then installed in the middle of the road and devotees soon started offering puja and different sevas.When an army of enemies tried to attack Visakha kings, 
             they destroyed the temple of Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi housed in the fort, putting the goddess into a well.
              Legend has it that the goddess appeared in the dream of a few devotees and made known her wish to install her idol without a roof.</p>
